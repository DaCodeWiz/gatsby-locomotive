This is a portfolio I made with the help of libraries like Gatsby and GSAP. Feel free to clone it and learn from my work. I just ask that if you fork or clone the repo try to credit me somewhere. This portfolio will constantly be updating and going through changes.

Step 1:
Fork/Clone the repository.
git clone repo **link to this repository**

Step 2:
Enter the directory,
cd app

Step 3:
Start the development server, npm run develop
